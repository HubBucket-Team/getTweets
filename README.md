# getTweets

This is a user-friendly R script for searching and downloading tweets using the Twitter API. It's heavily commented and should be pretty easy to follow, but please let me know if you run into any trouble.

This script will show you how to:

- install all the packages you need
- search for tweets
- tidy your data into a dataframe
- save your data out of R

To search for Tweets, you will need your own Twitter account and API keys. You can find out how to get API keys here: https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens
